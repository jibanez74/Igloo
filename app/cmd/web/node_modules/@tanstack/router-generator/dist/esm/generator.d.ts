     * Token regexes are pre-compiled once here and reused throughout route processing.
     * We need TWO types of regex for each token because they match against different inputs:
     *
     * 1. FILENAME regexes: Match token patterns within full file path strings.
     *    Example: For file "routes/dashboard.index.tsx", we want to detect ".index."
     *    Pattern: `[./](?:token)[.]` - matches token bounded by path separators/dots
     *    Used in: sorting route nodes by file path
     *
     * 2. SEGMENT regexes: Match token against a single logical route segment.
     *    Example: For segment "index" (extracted from path), match the whole segment
     *    Pattern: `^(?:token)$` - matches entire segment exactly
     *    Used in: route parsing, determining route types, escape detection
     *
     * We cannot reuse one for the other without false positives or missing matches.
